** 	b)  Communication plan to include project artifact repository**

  a. We conduct scrum call on zoom twice a week for providing update from everyone's end on project
  
  b. JIRA dashboard has been created to track task using agile methodologies (https://kiranbagwe.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/I6G1/boards/1)
  
  c. Github link with project repository has been also created (https://github.com/kbagwe/ITCS_6100_group_18)
  
  
  
**2)  Selection of data to analyze from the Open Data Registry for Amazon Web Services https://registry.opendata.aws/ **
   We are decided to go with the following topic:- 
       New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Record Data
       https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/
       
       Data:- https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page
       The data provides us Data of trips taken by taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City.

**3)  Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge (link to information on domain relative to data, problem, or opportunity)**

Some of the business problems that are being addressed are
   a.Lowering churn: Over the time of accessible data, the decreasing trend in the number of trips taken is examined. It's possible that this is related to the customers' preference for public transit.
   
   b.CAPEX optimization: Trip locations and how riders and taxis are assigned to each other have an impact on car fuel consumption and maintenance. The car's whole historical journey data is used to predict indicators of wear and tear of various elements of the car.
   
   c.Cross-selling: Bundling of various vendor services in a subscription package is correlated with increased trips taken by the subscribers. 
   
   d.Locations: The traveler fails to mention the trip's destination properly. The phone numbers of the driver and rider are not being updated. Taxi drivers are unable to discover the starting and finishing points of rides due to improved network, incorrect guidance of Google Maps that is connected to the firm applications, and being unfamiliar with the surrounding area. The pick-up site is a significant distance away, which results in a long wait period. Taxi drivers may only obtain a few rides in high-traffic areas and during peak hours. All of these issues contribute to a large consumption of petrol, as well as an increase in the price of journeys, which is not economically beneficial to the rider, and a significant amount of time is spent ( the efficiency of the ride will be very low and loose of the rider will increase)


**4)  Research Objectives and Question(s) (what you are trying to describe or predict with the data)**

   a. Pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip lengths, itemized rates, rate kinds, payment methods, and driver-reported passenger counts are all captured in the yellow and green cab trip records. Technology providers authorized under the Taxicab and Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP) gathered and supplied the data utilized in the linked datasets to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC).
   
   b. By identifying the maximum number of times a taxi has been dropped and picked by, we can create an analysis to determine whether the particular place should have taxis access all the time
   
   c. Same with the pick-up and drop-off time range we can determine the time when there is maximum requirement of taxis 
   
   d. Comparison between yellow taxis, green taxis, for-hire taxis, and High Volume of For-hire vehicles is done so that the importance of each taxi at a particular place and time can be determined.
   
   e. Data helping TLC to provide licenses to access which type of taxis and why
